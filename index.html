      <h2>Remedy</h2>

      
      <h6>In this project I created a brand for Remedy who deals with healing childhood trauma, more specifically overcoming childhood emotional neglect. Remedy offers a monthly care-package that provides various tools to help individuals overcome their past trauma by learning about their emotions and feelings. </h6>

      <h6>The brand was meant to feel welcoming and warm as to encourage growth and healing, but remain serious and sincere. Many design choices were made to reflect this idea, including colour, typeface, graphic elements and illustration style. This is an example of the monthly calendar with positive affirmations that would be included in the care-package.</h6>

      <h6>In this project I got to explore more of Canada’s wildlife and culture by learning about Algonquin National Park and the pine martens that live there. </h6> 

      <h6>
        To create this stamp design for Canada post, I sketched a pine marten by hand then converted it to a digital setting. This is where I added many other graphic elements and colours. I used different aspects of Canadian culture to create this final design including the Aurora Borealis and their colours.
